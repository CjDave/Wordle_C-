C# Console Version Of  The game "Wordle"

# About 
I've been enjoying playing the trending word game "Wordle". As a result of the game, for the past days/weeks/month, I go to bed anticipating the new word that appears at dawn. Some days it takes me seconds to find the word, other days minutes and on those really hard days a lot of minutes. I really enjoy the game, so as a programmer myself I decided to recreate the game.<br>
I made a simple implemntation of the core mechanics of the game using C# for a console application.
